# Hi! I'm David Qing.

I'm going to UC Berkeley, class of 2025. 

I love music, and always am listening to something new if I can!

## Some things that I've worked on!

### Gitlet, a version of Git, the version control system. 
* Used Java to implement commits, staging, branches, merging
* Created test cases for thorough unit testing. 
### A Scheme Interpreter using Python as its basis. 
* Implemented an evaluation system for a Scheme interpreter. 
* Used an imperative programming paradigm to interpret a functional programming paradigm.
### Voice-controlled Robot
* Created a driving robot based off a microcontroller. 
* Implemented signal processing of the voice to recognize different words.
