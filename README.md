# Hi! I'm David Qing.

I'm going to UC Berkeley, class of 2025. Computer science has always been an interest of mine, and I'm so glad to be working in the field now!

In my personal life, I love listening to music, and always try to find the latest album!

## Some projects that I've worked on!

### [Grading Portal for Web Design Decal](https://github.com/webdesigndecal/grading-portal)
* Building the grading portal for a class I teach, the Web Design Decal.
* Allows users to submit and view assignments, as well as providing static web hosting. 
* Creating designs and the lead developer for the project, working in Next.js and Supabase.

### [Matching Portal for Immigration Justice Project](https://github.com/calblueprint/immigration-justice-project)
#### [View the App](https://immigration-justice-project.vercel.app/cases)
* Building a portal matching attorneys with immigration dispute cases.
* Designing the user interface from zero-to-one using user research, usability testing, and design principles using Figma. 
* Creating the web application using Next.js and Supabase (with Typescript and Styled Components), shipped on Vercel.

### [Mobile App for Cultural Survival](https://github.com/calblueprint/cultural-survival-mobile)
* Worked with Cultural Survival, an indigenous led NGO. 
* Created a mobile application that works as a streaming and downloading platform for Cultural Survival's podcasts. 
* Used React Native, Typescript, MongoDB, and Node.js to build the frontend, backend, and connection to the database. 

### [JayZam](https://github.com/davidqing6432/JayZam)
* Used HTML/CSS/JS and Python to create an audio recognition software. 
* Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize snippets of songs. 
* Created a User Interface using frontend web development tools. 

### Gitlet, a version of Git, the version control system
* Used Java to implement commits, staging, branches, merging
* Created test cases for thorough unit testing. 

### A Scheme Interpreter using Python
* Implemented an evaluation system for a Scheme interpreter. 
* Used an imperative programming paradigm to interpret a functional programming paradigm.

### Voice-controlled Robot
* Created a driving robot based off a microcontroller. 
* Implemented signal processing of the voice to recognize different words.
