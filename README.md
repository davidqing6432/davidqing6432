# Hi! I'm David Qing.

I'm going to UC Berkeley, class of 2025. 

I love music, and always am listening to something new if I can!

## Classes I've taken in Berkeley!

    * Basic Python (variables, functions, iteration, recursion, lists)
    * Containers, iterators, generators, iterables
    * OOP, linked lists, trees
    * Scheme, interpreters
    * Regex, BNF, SQL, 
- CS61B: Data Structures
    * Basic Java (classes, variables, methods, compilation)
    * Using Git and Github
    * Pointers, Arrays, OOP
    * Unit-Testing
    * Abstraction, Packages, Implementation
    * Data Structures and Complexity (Trees, Linked Lists, BSTs, B-trees, Red-Black Trees, Graphs)
    * Searching and Sorting, Graph Theory, Dynamic Programming
- CS70: Discrete Mathematics and Probability Theory

    * Systems of linear equations, Gaussian Elimination, Vectors
    * Span, Proofs, Matrix Tranformations
    * Spaces, Vector Spaces, Rank, Eigenvalues/vectors/spaces
    * Circuit analysis (Resistors, voltage, current, resistance)
    * Superposition, equivalence.
    * Capacitors, Resistive and Capacitive Touchscreens
    * Op-amps, Least Squares, Machine Learning
    * Transistors, Inductors, Impedance
    * Phasors, Differential Equations, Diagonalization
    * System ID, Signal Processing
    * Discrete Time control, Stabilization, Controllability, Gram-Schmidt
    * SVD, PCA

## Some things that I've worked on!

- Gitlet, a version of Git, the version control system. 
    * Used Java to implement commits, staging, branches, merging
    * Created test cases for thorough unit testing. 
- A Scheme Interpreter using Python as its basis. 
    * Implemented an evaluation system for a Scheme interpreter. 
    * Used an imperative programming paradigm to interpret a functional programming paradigm.
- Voice-controlled Robot
    * Created a driving robot based off a microcontroller. 
    * Implemented signal processing of the voice to recognize different words.
